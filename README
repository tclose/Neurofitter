Usage
=====

Please first read the compilation and installation instruction that can be found 
in the INSTALL file.

To run Neurofitter first create a parameter XML file (e.g. parameters.xml), 
containing all the parameters you need to give to Neurofitter (information about
these parameters can be found in the file doc/XMLParameters). 
Next run Neurofitter with the command "Neurofitter parameters.xml" in the 
directory containing the executable.

FAQ
===

Q: How do I compile Neurofitter ?
A: Compilation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file

Q: I get an error message ...
A: Maybe your problem will be solved after you read the Troubleshooting section

Q: I have found an extremely good optimization algorithm, can it be used with 
Neurofitter ?
A: Great ! Neurofitter has been developed so that it can be extended as easily as 
possible. The only thing you need to do is to create your own derived class of
FitterInterface which implements the algorithm. For further information please
contact us at neurofitter.sourceforge.net or www.tnb.ua.ac.be 


Troubleshooting
===============

******* Problem:
You get an error message like: "Error in Neurofitter: Not enough arguments"

Analysis:
You always have to give a parameter file name as argument to the Neurofitter executable.
Did you do this ?


******* Problem:
You get some "parser error" message

Analysis:
This is probably caused by the XML parser which reads the parameter XML file. Are you
sure the syntax of your parameter is correct ? If it is, maybe you have found a bug
in Neurofitter or Libxml.


******* Problem:
While running Neurofitter you see that the fitness values you get for the model are not
correct, uninitialized or just all zero.

Analysis:
Maybe there is something wrong with the interface between Neurofitter and the model 
simulation software. Maybe you could check if the output of the model is generated 
correctly or if no errors occur while running the model. You can specify in the 
parameters of Neurofitter that a files should be generated with the stderr and stdout
of the command that runs the model. Maybe these contain some information ?
Also try to put the verboselevel at maximum so that you see all the information about
the matrices generated by Neurofitter


******** Problem:
It seems that Neurofitter "eats" all my memory

Analysis:
It could be that this caused by some parameters you set for Neurofitter. Don't use
e.g. too large dimensions for the V dVdt matrices. Another possibility is a memory 
leak in Neurofitter, maybe you could contact us at neurofitter.sourceforge.net or 
www.tnb.ua.ac.be


******** Problem:
Help ! I get an error message and I don't understand what it means :-(

Analysis:
Maybe you have found a bug in Neurofitter. You can always contact us at 
neurofitter.sourceforge.net or www.tnb.ua.ac.be
