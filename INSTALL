This file contains contains information about the compilation and installation process
of Neurofitter. If you want info about the "use" of Neurofitter, please look into the
README file

System Requirements
===================

UNIX / Linux / Mac OS X / Cygwin
GCC compiler 3.3+ installed
GNU Make installed
Libxml installed

Neurofitter has been succesfully compiled on:

Macintosh PPC G4/G5 Mac OS X Tiger/Panther with XCode 2.1+
Macintosh Intel Mac Os X Tiger with XCode 2.3
Intel Pentium III Windows 2000 / Cygwin 1.5.21
Intel Xeon 64-bit Linux Slackware
AMD 64-bit and Intel x86 Linux Fedora Core release 3
OpenPower SUSE Enterprise Linux 9
Intel x86 Sun Solaris 9

Compilation
===========


1. Decompress and extract the files from the Neurofitter distribution archive:

     tar zxf neurofitter-1.0.tar.gz

   This will extract the `neurofitter-1.0' directory.


2. Change to neurofitter-1.0, and execute the following command:

     ./configure

   Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
   messages telling which features it is checking for. When
   `configure' is done, Neurofitter can be compiled by issuing the
   following command:

     make

   After the build process has completed successfully, Neurofitter can
   be installed with the following command, which may require root
   privileges:

     make install

   By default, the Neurofitter program and accompanying scripts are
   installed in directory `/usr/local/bin'. To change this, use the
   --prefix option to configure:

   ./configure --prefix=/home/user

   This will install Neurofitter in directory /home/user/neurofitter.

3. Configuring Neurofitter for use with EO and NOMAD

   To compile Neurofitter with the EO interface, use the --with-eo
   argument to specify the location of the EO library.

   ./configure --with-eo=/usr/local/eo

   This assumes that directory `/usr/local/eo' contains subdirectories
   `lib' and `include' that contain the libraries and header files of
   eo, respectively. If a different layout is used, you may specify
   the locations of the eo headers and libraries separately:

   ./configure --with-eo-include=/usr/local/include/eo \
               --with-eo-libdir=/usr/local/lib/eo
   
   To configure Neurofitter for use with the NOMAD library:

   ./configure --with-nomad=/usr/local/nomad


4. Configuring Neurofitter for use with MPI

   When you want Neurofitter to be able to use the MPI interface,
   invoke configure with the --enable-mpi option:

   ./configure --enable-mpi

   This will require that the mpic++ program is accessible in the
   current path.  In this case, building Neurofitter will result in
   two executable files: neurofitter and mpineurofitter. The second
   executable contains the MPI functionality. 


Documentation
=============

Specific documentation file can be found in the "doc" directory

To create source code documentation one needs Doxygen. Specify in the Makefile 
where you installed Doxygen on your computer and then run "make doc". This 
documentation will be placed in the "doc/html" directory.


Troubleshooting
===============

******** Problem: 
You get an error message "Makefile, line xx: Need an operator" while compiling

Analysis: 
This probably means you use a non-GNU make system, try to compile with "gmake"
instead of "make" or otherwise install GNU make.


******** Problem:
You get an error message like "XMLString.h: libxml/parser.h: 
No such file or directory"

Analysis:
You maybe don't have the Libxml library installed on your system. Try to install
it, or check the Makefile to see if the location of Libxml is maybe different 
from the one specified in the Makefile


******** Problem:
You get an error message like "EOFitterInterface.h: error: es/make_es.h: No 
such file or directory".

Analysis:
It looks like EO cannot be found on your system. Is it installed ? Or have
you specified the right location in the Makefile of Neurofitter ? If you
don't want to use it, don't define DIR_EO in the Makefile


******** Problem:
You get an error message like "NOMADFitterInterface.h: error: nomad: No such 
file or directory".

Analysis:
It looks like NOMAD cannot be found on your system. Is it installed ? Or have
you specified the right location in the Makefile of Neurofitter ? If you
don't want to use it, don't define DIR_NOMAD in the Makefile


******** Problem
You are compiling Neurofitter in Cygwin, and you get a huge amount of warning 
message from the compiler (especially about C++ vectors)

Analysis:
This is not something to worry about, it seams this is an already known problem
with Cygwin, and shouldn't affect Neurofitter. If you really are getting annoyed
by these message you could try to remove the -pedantic and -Wall flags from
CXXFLAGS in the Neurofitter Makefile


******** Problem
You get an error message while compiling or running Neurofitter, and you don't 
understand what's wrong

Analysis:
Sorry, it looks like you might have found a bug, please contact us at
