This file contains contains information about the compilation and installation process
of Neurofitter. If you want info about the "use" of Neurofitter, please look into the
README file

System Requirements
===================

UNIX / Linux / Mac OS X / Cygwin
GCC compiler 3.3+ installed
GNU Make installed
Libxml installed

Neurofitter has been succesfully compiled on:

Macintosh PPC G4/G5 Mac OS X Tiger/Panther with XCode 2.1+
Macintosh Intel Mac Os X Tiger with XCode 2.3
Intel Pentium III Windows 2000 / Cygwin 1.5.21
Intel Xeon 64-bit Linux Slackware
AMD 64-bit and Intel x86 Linux Fedora Core release 3
OpenPower SUSE Enterprise Linux 9
Intel x86 Sun Solaris 9

Compilation
===========

Change directory to the directory where you installed Neurofitter/
Before starting the compilation, first check the top of the Makefile and specify
parameters that are maybe specific for your system. If you want to use the interface
with EO or NOMAD, you should install these software packages (together with the
patch provided on the website of Neurofitter) and specify their location on your
system in the Neurofitter Makefile.
The start the compilation just type "make". When your system's default Make system 
is not GNU Make, you should use "gmake". (When GNU make is not installed, you should 
probably install it).

In the "bin" directory the executable file Neurofitter is created by the compiler


MPI
===

When you want Neurofitter to be able to use the MPI interface, type "make mpi" instead
of "make" during the compilation process. The executable in the "bin" directory will 
then be called MPINeurofitter.


Documentation
=============

Specific documentation file can be found in the "doc" directory

To create source code documentation one needs Doxygen. Specify in the Makefile 
where you installed Doxygen on your computer and then run "make doc". This 
documentation will be placed in the "doc/html" directory.


Troubleshooting
===============

******** Problem: 
You get an error message "Makefile, line xx: Need an operator" while compiling

Analysis: 
This probably means you use a non-GNU make system, try to compile with "gmake"
instead of "make" or otherwise install GNU make.


******** Problem:
You get an error message like "XMLString.h: libxml/parser.h: 
No such file or directory"

Analysis:
You maybe don't have the Libxml library installed on your system. Try to install
it, or check the Makefile to see if the location of Libxml is maybe different 
from the one specified in the Makefile


******** Problem:
You get an error message like "EOFitterInterface.h: error: es/make_es.h: No 
such file or directory".

Analysis:
It looks like EO cannot be found on your system. Is it installed ? Or have
you specified the right location in the Makefile of Neurofitter ? If you
don't want to use it, don't define DIR_EO in the Makefile


******** Problem:
You get an error message like "NOMADFitterInterface.h: error: nomad: No such 
file or directory".

Analysis:
It looks like NOMAD cannot be found on your system. Is it installed ? Or have
you specified the right location in the Makefile of Neurofitter ? If you
don't want to use it, don't define DIR_NOMAD in the Makefile


******** Problem
You are compiling Neurofitter in Cygwin, and you get a huge amount of warning 
message from the compiler (especially about C++ vectors)

Analysis:
This is not something to worry about, it seams this is an already known problem
with Cygwin, and shouldn't affect Neurofitter. If you really are getting annoyed
by these message you could try to remove the -pedantic and -Wall flags from
CXXFLAGS in the Neurofitter Makefile


******** Problem
You get an error message while compiling or running Neurofitter, and you don't 
understand what's wrong

Analysis:
Sorry, it looks like you might have found a bug, please contact us at
