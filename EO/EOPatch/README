To apply the patch:

Download EO from http://eodev.sourceforge.net (release 0.9.3z.1)

Unpack EO

Change directory to the eo-0.9.3z.1 directory 

Run the command "patch -p1 <EOPATCHLOCATION/EO.Neurofitter-0.9.1.patch
(where EOPATCHLOCATION is the directory containing the patch)


To compile EO:

Run the following commands in the eo-0.9.3z.1 directory:
./configure (maybe you have to do this more than 1 time)
make


Now you can adapt the Makefile of Neurofitter so that it points to the directory containing EO
