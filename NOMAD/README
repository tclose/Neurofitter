Adapted by Werner Van Geit in 2006
This version of NOMAD has been adapted by Werner Van Geit to allow communication with the software package Neurofitter
Information about Neurofitter can be found on neurofitter.sourceforge.net or www.tnb.ua.ac.be.

The code has been adapted so that it asks for the computation of a LIST of fitness values in parallel
It is also now possible to compile NOMAD in a library format so that it can be used to be linked to external software.

Compilation for Neurofitter should be done with make -f Lib_Makefile_parallel

Parts in the source code that have been adapted are marked with a comment containing "WVG"
