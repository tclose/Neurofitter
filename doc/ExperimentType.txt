There are two types:

- File
	This reads the experimental traces from files with fixed filenames. The filename should be of the form
	output_Run0.dat, output_Run1.dat, output_Run2.dat, ...  where "output" is the prefix 
	as specified in the NormalTracesReader. There should be 1 file for every run (1 run is
	e.g. 1 current injection strength).
	Settings: 
	 	<FilesDirectory>...<FilesDirectory>
		Specifies where the directory with the experimental data is

- FileList
	This reads the experimental traces from files with filenames specified by the user.
	Settings:
		<FilesList>...<FilesList>
		In between the two XML tags should be a newline-delimited listed of filenames. The number of files should be the
		same as the "NumberOfRuns" of the TracesReader. Tabs or spaces can be added before or after the filenames, and will be 
		discarded.

- Fake
	This type will not read the experimental data from files but will generate "fake" experimental 
	data based on running the model with a set of parameters you provide
	Settings:
		<Parameters>...</Parameters>
