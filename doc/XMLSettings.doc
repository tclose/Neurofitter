This file describes how to create a settings.xml file for the Neurofitter software.

The file should have the following format (... should be filled in):

<TestProgram>
	<Dimensions>...</Dimensions>
    <VerboseLevel>...</VerboseLevel>
    <Seed>...</Seed>

    <SamplingFrequency>...</SamplingFrequency>
    <StartingPoints>
        ...
    </StartingPoints>
    <Bounds>
		...
    </Bounds>
    <WorkingDirectory>...</WorkingDirectory>

    <PrintParameterFile>...</PrintParameterFile>

	<FitterType>...</FitterType>
    <FitterParameters>
		...
    </FitterParameters>

    <TracesReaderType>...</TracesReaderType>
    <TracesReaderParameters>
		...
    </TracesReaderParameters>

	<ModelType>...</ModelType>
    <ModelParameters>
		...
    </ModelParameters>

	<ExperimentType>...</ExperimentType>
    <ExperimentParameters>
		...
    </ExperimentParameters>

	<ErrorValueCalculatorType>...</ErrorValueCalculatorType>
    <ErrorValueCalculatorParameters>
		...
    </ErrorValueCalculatorParameters>
</TestProgram>


Dimensions
==========
This is an integer describing the number of model parameters you want to fit, so it is the number of dimensions 
of the hyperspace the optimization algorithm will search in.

VerboseLevel
============
This integer tells how much output Neurofitter will write to stdout while it is running. The higher the integer,
the more output. At verboselevel 0 Neurofitter will show no output.

Seed
====
The random seed used in the stochastic optimization algorithms.

SamplingFrequency
=================
The sampling frequency of your experimental data and the model output. The units of this value should match these
of the timestamps used in your data files.

StartingPoints
==============
The parameter sets that should be used initialize the optimization algorithm, this will not work for every optimization
algorithm

Bounds
======
The bounds of your model parameters. One line per parameter. 
E.g.
	<Bounds>
        1.0 10000.0 <!-- LowerBound UpperBound -->
        1.0 50000.0
    </Bounds>
Put's the bounds of parameter 1 at [1.0 10000.0] and parameter 2 at [1.0 50000.0].

WorkingDirectory
================
Location where you want to let Neurofitter write it's output

PrintParameterFile
==================
If this is set to 1 it means Neurofitter will write the settings file to stdout before starting. This is handy if you will save
the Neurofitter stdout output for later, and you still want to know the settings file you used.
If set to 0, Neurofitter won't print the settings.xml file

FitterType
==========
Determines the optimization algorithm used, please refer to the FitterType.doc documentation file

TracesReaderType
================
Determines the output data reader used, please refer to the TracesReaderType.doc documentation file

ModelType
=========
Determines the model type (software) used, please refer to the ModelType.doc documentation file

ExperimentType
==============
Determines the way experimental data is read by Neurofitter, please refer to the ExperimentType.doc documentation file

ErrorValueCalculatorType
=====================
Determines the algorithm by Neurofitter to convert output data into a error value, please refer to the ErrorValueCalculatorType.doc documentation file

Root tag
========
The root tag in this case is <TestProgram>, but the exact string that is used for this has no meaning for Neurofitter,
so you can change it to whatever name you like, like <PCModelFitting>. You shouldn't use any of the tags already in
use by Neurofitter
