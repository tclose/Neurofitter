ModelType determines which simulator is being used to simulate the model

	<ModelType>...</ModelType>
    <ModelParameters>
		...
	</ModelParameters>

Possible types are:

- Neuron
	Interface to the Neuron neuron simulator.
	Settings:
		The location of the Neuron special file 
        	<SpecialLocation>...</SpecialLocation>
		
		The directory that contains the Neuron model files
        	<ModelDirectory>...</ModelDirectory>

		The directory that will contain the output files of the model
        	<OutputDirectory>...</OutputDirectory>

		The root source file (.hoc) of the model
        	<ModelSource>...</ModelSource>

		The filename that Neurofitter has to use to write the file that contains the information for Neuron
        	<ParameterFile>...</ParameterFile>

		Set to 1 if you want to see Neuron stdout output (handy for debugging), 0 if not. 
        	<ShowExecuteOutput>0</ShowExecuteOutput>
	

- Genesis
	Interface to the Genesis neuron simulator.
	Settings:
		The location of the genesis binary
			<GenesisLocation>...</GenesisLocation>

		The directory that contains the genesis model files
        	<ModelDirectory>...</ModelDirectory>

		The directory that will contain the output files of the model
        	<OutputDirectory>...</OutputDirectory>

		The root source file (.g) of the model
        	<ModelSource>...</ModelSource>

		The filename that Neurofitter has to use to write the file that contains the information for genesis
        	<ParameterFile>...</ParameterFile>

		Set to 1 if you want to see genesis stdout output (handy for debugging), 0 if not. 
        	<ShowExecuteOutput>0</ShowExecuteOutput>


- Executable
	Interface to a generic neuron simulator.
	Settings:
		The location of the genesis binary
			<ExecuteCommand>...</ExecuteCommand>

		The directory that will contain the output files of the model
        	<OutputDirectory>...</OutputDirectory>

		The filename that Neurofitter has to use to write the file that contains the information for the executable
        	<ParameterFile>...</ParameterFile>

		Set to 1 if you want to see genesis stdout output (handy for debugging), 0 if not. 
        	<ShowExecuteOutput>0</ShowExecuteOutput>
