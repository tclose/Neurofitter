There are two types:

- File
	This reads the experimental traces from files. The filename should be of the form
	output_Run0.dat, output_Run1.dat, output_Run2.dat, ...  where "output" is the prefix 
	as specified in the NormalTracesReader. There should be 1 file for every run (1 run is
	e.g. 1 current injection strength).
	Settings: 
	 	<FilesDirectory>...<FilesDirectory>
		Specifies where the directory with the experimental data is

- Fake
	This type will not read the experimental data from files but will generate "fake" experimental 
	data based on running the model with a set of parameters you provide
	Settings:
		<Parameters>...</Parameters>
